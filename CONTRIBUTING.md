- **Documentation**: Tutorials, examples, and explanations
- **Testing**: Unit tests and validation experiments

### 4. Research Contributions

If you conduct experiments or develop theoretical extensions:
- Document your methodology clearly
- Include code and data when possible
- Reference the original DQM framework
- Submit findings via pull request or issue discussion

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Directed-Quantum-Measurement-DQM.git
cd Directed-Quantum-Measurement-DQM
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### 3. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv dqm-env

# Activate it
# Windows:
.\dqm-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Linux/macOS:
source dqm-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_dqm.txt
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, commented code
- Follow existing code style
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include examples where helpful

### 5. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run your new code
python your_new_script.py

# Test with different parameters
# Verify on local simulator before IBM backends
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:

```python
# Function naming: lowercase with underscores
def directional_field(theta, phi):
    """
    Calculate the directional quantum field value.
    
    Args:
        theta (float): Angular parameter in radians
        phi (float): Angular parameter in radians
    
    Returns:
        float: Bias value between 0 and 1
    """
    return 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(theta) * cos(phi)

# Constants: UPPERCASE
MAX_SHOTS = 1024
DEFAULT_THETA = pi / 3

# Class naming: CamelCase
class QuantumMeasurementSimulator:
    pass
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include mathematical notation when needed (LaTeX/KaTeX)
- Provide examples for complex concepts
- Link to relevant papers or resources

### Commit Style

```
Type: Brief description (50 chars max)

Longer explanation if needed. Explain what and why,
not how (the code shows how).

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues: Fixes #123
```

**Types:** `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`, `Remove`, `Refactor`, `Docs`
