  - `dqm-env/` (virtual environment)
  - IBM credentials files
  - Token configuration files
  - `__pycache__/` and Python artifacts
- [x] No personal credentials in any file
- [x] No hardcoded passwords or secrets
- [x] Environment-specific configurations removed

## ‚úÖ Documentation Checklist

- [x] `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- [x] `SETUP.md` - Detailed installation and setup guide
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- [x] `LICENSE` - MIT License file
- [x] All code files have appropriate comments
- [x] Theory sections properly documented
- [x] References and citations included

## ‚úÖ Code Quality Checklist

- [x] All Python files follow PEP 8 style
- [x] Functions have docstrings
- [x] No debug print statements (unless intentional)
- [x] No broken imports
- [x] Example code is tested and working
- [x] File paths are relative (not absolute)

## ‚úÖ Repository Structure Checklist

- [x] Proper directory organization
- [x] Consistent file naming
- [x] No unnecessary files (temporary, IDE-specific)
- [x] Virtual environment not included in repo
- [x] Only source code and documentation

## ‚úÖ GitHub-Specific Checklist

- [ ] Repository name: `Directed-Quantum-Measurement-DQM`
- [ ] Repository description set
- [ ] Topics/tags added (quantum-computing, qiskit, quantum-measurement)
- [ ] GitHub repository is public
- [ ] Repository URL: https://github.com/OMARINO-DE/Directed-Quantum-Measurement-DQM

## üöÄ Git Commands for First Push

### 1. Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
cd "d:\Dev\Directed Quantum Measurement"
git init
```

### 2. Add Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/OMARINO-DE/Directed-Quantum-Measurement-DQM.git
```

### 3. Stage All Files

```bash
git add .
```

### 4. Verify What Will Be Committed

```bash
git status
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Check that no files with tokens are staged!**

Look for:
- No files containing API tokens
- `dqm-env/` is NOT in the list (should be ignored)
- No `__pycache__/` directories

### 5. Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Directed Quantum Measurement (DQM) framework by Omar Zaror"
```

### 6. Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üìã Post-Push Verification

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

- [ ] README.md displays correctly
- [ ] All links work (SETUP.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE)
- [ ] No sensitive information visible
- [ ] Repository description is set
- [ ] Topics are added
- [ ] License is recognized by GitHub

## üîí Final Security Check

Run this command to search for potential secrets:

```bash
# Search for common token patterns
git grep -i "token" | grep -v "YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN" | grep -v "# Get your token"
git grep -i "password"
git grep -i "api_key"
```

If any real tokens/passwords are found, **DO NOT PUSH** until they are removed.
