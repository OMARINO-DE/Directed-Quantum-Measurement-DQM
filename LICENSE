## Research Disclaimer

This software presents a speculative theoretical framework exploring the 
boundaries of quantum measurement theory. The experiments and simulations are 
designed for research and educational purposes. All results should be 
independently verified and peer-reviewed before drawing definitive conclusions.

The software does not claim to violate established physical laws but rather 
explores edge cases and alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics within 
the framework of Directed Quantum Measurement (DQM) theory.
